### Problem 1: Comment Practice

**Problem:** Create a Python script that contains at least three different types of comments: single-line comments, multi-line comments, and comments within code lines.

**Solution:**
```python
# This is a single-line comment

'''
This is a multi-line comment.
It spans multiple lines.
'''

# This is a single-line comment with code:
print("Hello, World!")  # This is a comment after a statement
```

### Problem 2: String Concatenation

**Problem:** Write a Python program that takes two strings as input and concatenates them into one.

**Solution:**
```python
# Input
string1 = input("Enter the first string: ")
string2 = input("Enter the second string: ")

# Concatenate the strings
result = string1 + string2

# Output
print("Concatenated string:", result)
```

### Problem 3: Simple Calculation

**Problem:** Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and performs addition and multiplication on them.

**Solution:**
```python
# Input
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum and product
sum_result = num1 + num2
product_result = num1 * num2

# Output
print("Sum:", sum_result)
print("Product:", product_result)
```

### Problem 4: Exponent Calculation

**Problem:** Write a Python program that calculates the square of a number entered by the user.

**Solution:**
```python
# Input
num = float(input("Enter a number: "))

# Calculate the square
square = num ** 2

# Output
print("Square:", square)
```

### Problem 5: Modulo Practice

**Problem:** Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and finds the remainder when the first number is divided by the second number.

**Solution:**
```python
# Input
num1 = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the divisor: "))

# Calculate the remainder
remainder = num1 % num2

# Output
print("Remainder:", remainder)
```

These problems cover the topics of comments, strings, variables, numbers, calculations, exponents, and modulo. They are designed to be simple exercises to help reinforce your understanding of these concepts in Python.
