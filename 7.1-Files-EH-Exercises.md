### Exercise 1: Log File Analysis

**Problem Statement:** You have a log file (`log.txt`) containing various log entries. Each log entry is a string that may contain errors. Write a Python program to read the log file, identify and count the number of error entries, and write the error entries to a new file (`errors.txt`) for further analysis.

You can use this log file with the provided Python program to count and extract error entries into a log.txt file.

[INFO] Application started.<br>
[ERROR] An error occurred while processing data: Division by zero.<br>
[INFO] Processing complete.<br>
[DEBUG] Debugging information: Variable x = 5, Variable y = 0.<br>
[ERROR] Another error occurred: File not found.<br>
[INFO] Application stopped.<br>
[WARNING] This is a warning message.<br>
[ERROR] Yet another error: Out of memory.<br>
[INFO] Application restarted.<br>

**Solution:**

```python
# Exercise 1 Solution
try:
    error_count = 0
    with open('log.txt', 'r') as log_file, open('errors.txt', 'w') as error_file:
        for line in log_file:
            if 'ERROR' in line:
                error_count += 1
                error_file.write(line)
    print(f"Total errors found: {error_count}")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Log file not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Exercise 2: CSV File Parsing

**Problem Statement:** You have a CSV file (`data.csv`) containing tabular data. Write a Python program to read the CSV file, parse its contents, and calculate the average of a specific column (e.g., column 3) while handling potential file and data parsing errors.

**Solution:**

```python
# Exercise 2 Solution
try:
    total = 0
    row_count = 0
    with open('data.csv', 'r') as csv_file:
        for line in csv_file:
            try:
                values = line.strip().split(',')
                column_3_value = float(values[2])
                total += column_3_value
                row_count += 1
            except (IndexError, ValueError):
                pass  # Skip invalid data
    if row_count > 0:
        average = total / row_count
        print(f"Average of column 3: {average:.2f}")
    else:
        print("No valid data found.")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("CSV file not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Exercise 3: File Encryption

**Problem Statement:** Create a Python program that encrypts the content of a text file (`plain.txt`) using a simple substitution cipher and writes the encrypted content to another file (`encrypted.txt`). Handle potential file and encryption errors gracefully.

**Solution:**

```python
# Exercise 3 Solution
def encrypt(text):
    encrypted_text = ""
    for char in text:
        encrypted_char = chr(ord(char) + 1)  # Simple Caesar cipher shift by 1
        encrypted_text += encrypted_char
    return encrypted_text

try:
    with open('plain.txt', 'r') as input_file, open('encrypted.txt', 'w') as output_file:
        plain_text = input_file.read()
        encrypted_text = encrypt(plain_text)
        output_file.write(encrypted_text)
    print("Encryption complete.")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Input file not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Exercise 4: Binary Data Analysis

**Problem Statement:** You have a binary data file (`data.bin`) containing a sequence of integers. Write a Python program to read the binary data, calculate the sum of all integers, and handle potential file and data parsing errors.

To generate a binary data file (data.bin) containing a sequence of integers, you can use the following Python code to create and write binary data to the file:

```python
import struct

# Sample sequence of integers
integers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

try:
    with open('data.bin', 'wb') as binary_file:
        for integer in integers:
            # Pack the integer into 4 bytes using big-endian byte order
            binary_data = struct.pack('>i', integer)
            binary_file.write(binary_data)
    print("Binary data file 'data.bin' created successfully.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

This code will create a binary file named data.bin and write the integers from the integers list to the file in 4-byte binary format with big-endian byte order.

**Solution:**

```python
# Exercise 4 Solution
try:
    total = 0
    with open('data.bin', 'rb') as binary_file:
        while True:
            try:
                value = int.from_bytes(binary_file.read(4), byteorder='big')
                total += value
            except ValueError:
                break  # Reached the end of the file
    print(f"Sum of integers in binary file: {total}")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Binary data file not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Exercise 5: JSON File Handling

**Problem Statement:** You have a JSON file (`data.json`) containing a list of dictionaries. Write a Python program to read the JSON file, extract specific information from the dictionaries, and handle potential file and data parsing errors.

**Solution:**

```python
# Exercise 5 Solution
import json

try:
    with open('data.json', 'r') as json_file:
        data = json.load(json_file)
        for item in data:
            try:
                name = item['name']
                age = item['age']
                print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}")
            except KeyError:
                print("Incomplete data in JSON.")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("JSON file not found.")
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    print("Invalid JSON format.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```
