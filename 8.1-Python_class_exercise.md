## Problem 1: Basic Class Definition
Problem: Create a Python class named Book with two attributes: title and author. Then, create an object of this class and assign the title "1984" and author "George Orwell" to this object. Finally, print the title and author of the book using the created object.

## Solution:

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author

book1 = Book("1984", "George Orwell")
print(book1.title)
print(book1.author)
```

## Problem 2: Method in Class
Problem: Define a class Circle with an attribute radius and a method area that calculates and returns the area of the circle. Assume Ï€ (pi) as 3.14.

## Solution:

```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.area())
```

## Problem 3: Importing Modules

Problem: Create a Python module named math_operations.py containing a function add that adds two numbers. Then, write another Python script to import this module and use the add function to sum 10 and 20.

## Solution:

```python
Copy code
# In math_operations.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# In another Python script
import math_operations
result = math_operations.add(10, 20)
print(result)
```
## Problem 4: Inheritance
Problem: Create a base class Vehicle with a method display_vehicle_type that prints "This is a vehicle". Then, create a subclass Car that inherits from Vehicle and overrides the method to print "This is a car".

## Solution:

```python
Copy code
class Vehicle:
    def display_vehicle_type(self):
        print("This is a vehicle")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def display_vehicle_type(self):
        print("This is a car")

car = Car()
car.display_vehicle_type()
```

## Problem 5: Encapsulation
Problem: Define a class Counter with a private attribute count initialized to 0 and a method increment that increases the count by 1. Add another method get_count that returns the current value of count.

## Solution:

```python
Copy code
class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__count = 0

    def increment(self):
        self.__count += 1

    def get_count(self):
        return self.__count

counter = Counter()
counter.increment()
print(counter.get_count())
```
These problems cover fundamental aspects of classes, object-oriented programming, and modules in Python, ideal for beginners to get hands-on experience.
